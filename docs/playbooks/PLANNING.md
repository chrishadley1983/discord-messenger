# Planning Playbook

READ THIS before creating any plan, itinerary, schedule, or multi-step proposal.

## The Standard

Chris is a methodical planner. When he asks you to plan something, he wants a
structured, actionable plan — not vague suggestions. Plans should account for
real constraints and use available data sources.

## Before You Start

Gather context:
- Check /calendar for existing commitments and conflicts
- Check memory context for relevant personal details (who's involved, preferences)
- Check /weather/forecast if the plan is date-specific
- Check /directions for travel times between locations if relevant

## Plan Types

### Day Plan / Itinerary
- Time-blocked format: "09:00 — Activity (location, ~Xh)"
- Include travel times between locations (use /directions)
- Account for meals and rest stops
- Weather-aware: flag rain risks or extreme temperatures
- End with "Booking/prep needed" checklist

### Week Plan / Schedule
- Day-by-day grid format
- Distinguish fixed events (from calendar) vs flexible slots
- Highlight clashes or overloaded days
- Balance intensity (don't stack every day)

### Project Plan / Multi-Step
- Numbered steps with clear dependencies
- Estimated effort per step
- Decision points clearly marked with ❓
- "Start with" recommendation

## What GOOD Looks Like

🗾 **[Location] Day Plan — [Date]**

🌤️ Forecast: [from /weather]

📍 **09:00** — [Activity] (~Xh)
[How to get there] | [Kid/family notes if relevant]

📍 **11:30** — [Lunch option]
💰 [Price range + currency] | [Booking requirement]

📍 **13:00** — [Afternoon activity]
[Practical detail: tickets, queues, alternatives]

📋 **Needs prep:**
- [ ] Actionable checklist items

## What BAD Looks Like

❌ "You could visit X, then maybe Y, and there are some good restaurants
in the area." (no times, no logistics, no detail)
❌ A plan that ignores travel time between locations
❌ Suggestions without prices or booking requirements

## Key Principle

Every plan should be actionable enough that it could be handed to someone
else and executed without further research.
