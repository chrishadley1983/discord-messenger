# Analysis Playbook

READ THIS before doing any data analysis, comparison, or trend assessment.

## The Standard

Analysis means insight extraction, not data presentation. Chris can read numbers
himself — he needs you to tell him what they MEAN.

## Process

1. **Gather the data** — use relevant APIs/skills to collect current data
2. **Compare** — against targets, previous periods, benchmarks
3. **Identify patterns** — what's trending up/down, what's anomalous
4. **Explain why** — hypothesize causes based on available information
5. **Recommend action** — what should Chris do about this

## What GOOD Looks Like

📊 **[Domain] Analysis — [Period]**

**Verdict:** [One sentence — is it good, bad, concerning, on track?]

[3-5 key metrics with targets and ✅/⚠️/❌ indicators]

**The story:** [2-3 sentences explaining what's driving the numbers.
Identify the cause, not just the symptom.]

💡 **Suggestion:** [Specific, actionable recommendation]

## What BAD Looks Like

❌ "Your metric was X this month" (so what?)
❌ Data without interpretation
❌ No comparison to targets or previous periods
❌ Analysis without actionable recommendations

## Key Principles

- **Lead with the verdict** — is it good, bad, concerning, or on track?
- **Compare to something** — targets, last week/month, historical average
- **Highlight anomalies** — what's unexpected or changing?
- **Causal reasoning** — don't just say what, explain why
- **Actionable close** — what should change (if anything)?
