# Research Playbook

READ THIS before answering any research, recommendation, or "tell me about" query.

## The Standard

When Chris asks you to research something, he wants a CURATED EXPERT BRIEFING —
not a list of links, not a surface-level summary. He wants you to be the researcher
who spent an hour reading, and then tells him what matters.

## Process

1. **Search broadly** — minimum 3 searches, different angles
2. **Read actual pages** — use WebFetch on the top 2-3 results. Snippets aren't enough.
3. **Synthesize** — combine findings into YOUR analysis. Don't parrot sources.
4. **Structure** — organize by what Chris needs to decide/know, not by source
5. **Recommend** — give your opinion. "Based on my research, I'd suggest X because..."
6. **Sources at the end** — not as the answer, but as references

## What GOOD Looks Like

🍖 **Kobe Beef in Kobe — Top 3 Picks**

After researching reviews, local guides, and booking sites:

**1. [Restaurant Name]** ⭐ Best Overall
Concept/style description
💰 Price range per person
📍 Address / area
⏰ Booking lead time

**2. [Restaurant Name]** ⭐ Best Value
Same structure

**3. [Restaurant Name]** ⭐ Most [Relevant Quality]
Same structure

💡 **Tips**
- 2-3 practical insider tips from research
- Things that save money/time/hassle

**Sources:** Named sources, not URLs

## What BAD Looks Like

❌ "Here are some results I found:
1. https://example.com/article
2. https://example.com/other"

❌ A wall of text with no structure or recommendations

❌ Copying/pasting search snippets without synthesis

❌ Recommendations without prices, locations, or booking info

## Depth Calibration

| Query Type | Expected Depth |
|-----------|---------------|
| "What time does X close?" | 1 search, 2-line answer |
| "Best restaurants in X" | 3+ searches, read pages, structured recs |
| "Should I buy X or Y?" | Research both, pros/cons, clear recommendation |
| "Tell me about X" | Deep dive, multiple sources, expert synthesis |
| "Research X for [project/trip]" | Comprehensive, detailed, actionable |

## The Rule

If you're not sure whether something needs deep research or a quick answer,
go deeper. Chris prefers thoroughness over speed.

## Tools for Research

### Web Search
- `brave_web_search` / `WebSearch` — General web queries
- `brave_local_search` — Restaurants, shops, "near me" queries
- `WebFetch` — Fetch and read actual page content (don't just rely on snippets)

### Research Process (CRITICAL)

1. **DO NOT just return a list of links** — that's useless
2. **Actually research the topic:**
   - Search for information (multiple queries if needed)
   - Use `WebFetch` to READ the actual content of promising pages
   - Synthesize findings from multiple sources
3. **Provide a curated, detailed response:**
   - Write a proper answer with your analysis
   - Include specific details, prices, ratings, pros/cons
   - Organize with headers if appropriate
   - Add your recommendations based on findings
4. **Sources go at the END, not as the answer:**
   ```

   **Sources:**
   - [Site Name](url)
   - [Site Name](url)
   ```

### When to Do Deep Research vs Quick Lookup

**Deep research required:**
- "Recommend X", "best places for X", "where should I..."
- "Tell me about X", "research X", "what are the options for..."
- Travel planning, major purchases, comparisons
- Any question where a simple answer isn't enough

**Quick lookup (single search OK):**
- "What time does X close?"
- "What's the weather in X?"
- "Who won the match?"
- Simple facts with clear answers
