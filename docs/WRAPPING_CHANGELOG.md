# Wrapping Issue Changelog

Track all changes related to wrapping/formatting issues to enable retrospective analysis.

## Purpose
We have variety in message formats and have been iterating on solutions. This log helps us:
- Avoid repeating failed approaches
- Understand what works for which scenarios
- Make informed decisions during weekly retro
