# Hadley Bricks Pick List

## Purpose

Generates consolidated picking lists for Amazon and eBay orders. Shows items that need to be picked from inventory for shipping. Scheduled for 7am daily or triggered conversationally.

## Pre-fetched Data

Data is pre-fetched from the Hadley Bricks API:

- `data.amazon`: Amazon picking list
  - `items`: Array of items to pick
    - `sku`: Product SKU
    - `set_number`: LEGO set number
    - `set_name`: LEGO set name
    - `quantity`: Quantity to pick
    - `location`: Storage location
    - `order_id`: Amazon order ID
- `data.ebay`: eBay picking list
  - `items`: Array of items to pick (same structure)
- `data.fetch_time`: When data was fetched

## Output Format

```
📋 **Pick List** - Mon 3 Feb

**Amazon** (3 items)
• 75192 Millennium Falcon x1 → A3-B2
• 10300 DeLorean x2 → C1-A1
• 42143 Ferrari Daytona → D2-C3

**eBay** (2 items)
• 10497 Galaxy Explorer x1 → A1-B4
• 21330 Home Alone x1 → B2-A1

Total: 5 items to pick
```

## Rules

- Group by platform (Amazon first, then eBay)
- Show location codes for easy picking
- Combine duplicates with quantity
- Keep set names short if needed
- If no items to pick, celebrate: `✅ All caught up! No items to pick.`
- Show total count at bottom

## Error Handling

If a platform fails:
```
📋 **Pick List** - Mon 3 Feb

**Amazon** (3 items)
• 75192 Millennium Falcon x1 → A3-B2
...

**eBay**: ⚠️ Data unavailable

Total: 3 items (Amazon only)
```

## Examples

**Both platforms have items:**
```

## Missing / just-placed order?

The pick list and `/hb/orders` only show what has already been imported. If an
order Chris mentions is missing, trigger the import and re-fetch — never guess
other endpoint names (see `docs/playbooks/BUSINESS.md` → "Missing order?"):

```
POST http://172.19.64.1:8100/hb/sync/trigger      → 202 {accepted: true}
sleep 180
GET  http://172.19.64.1:8100/hb/sync/status       → running:false, ok:true
GET  http://172.19.64.1:8100/hb/picking-list/amazon?format=json
```

`/hb/orders/refresh`, `/hb/orders/sync`, `/hb/workflow/sync-all` and `/hb/cron/*`
are NOT valid — they 401/404/504.
