# Hadley Bricks Add Inventory (No Purchase)

## Purpose

Adds inventory items that DON'T have an associated purchase record:
- Items received from suppliers (not yet invoiced)
- Gifts or samples
- Items from existing stock not in system
- Transfers from personal collection

**For normal purchases, use `hb-add-purchase` instead** - it creates both purchase AND inventory via batch-import.

## When to Use This Skill

| Scenario | Use This Skill? |

| Received from supplier, invoice pending | ✅ Yes |
| Gift / sample / freebie | ✅ Yes |
| Found in storage, not in system | ✅ Yes |
| Personal collection → business | ✅ Yes |
