## Grading Criteria

Calculate based on:
- **Weight (20pts)**: Lost >0.5kg = 20, lost any = 15, maintained = 10, gained = 5
- **Protein (25pts)**: Based on protein_days_hit / days_tracked ratio
- **Steps (25pts)**: Based on days_hit_goal / days ratio
- **Sleep (15pts)**: ≥7.5h = 15, ≥7h = 12, ≥6.5h = 8, else = 4
- **Heart Rate (15pts)**: ≤55 = 15, ≤60 = 12, ≤65 = 8, else = 4

Grade scale: A+ (≥90%), A (≥80%), B (≥70%), C (≥60%), D (≥50%), F (<50%)

## Rules

- Use actual numbers from the data - don't make up values
- If a section has no data (empty object), show "⚠️ No data this week"
- Compare everything to targets where available
- Celebrate wins explicitly
- Be specific about what to improve
- Reference Japan goal to maintain motivation
- Keep it comprehensive but scannable
- Grade should be fair but encouraging
- Use ✅ for metrics at 90%+ of target
