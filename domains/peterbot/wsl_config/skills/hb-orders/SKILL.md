# Hadley Bricks Orders

## Purpose

## Pre-fetched Data

  - `order_id`: Platform order ID
  - `platform`: "Amazon" or "eBay"
  - `status`: Order status (Paid, Pending)
  - `ordered_at`: When order was placed
  - `items`: Array of items in order
  - `total`: Order total
  - `buyer`: Buyer name/username
- `data.error`: Error message if fetch failed

## Rules

- Group by platform with color indicators (🟠 Amazon, 🔵 eBay)
- Show order age relative to today (Today, 1 day old, 2 days old, etc.)
- Highlight urgent orders (>2 days old)
- If no orders, celebrate: `✅ All orders dispatched!`
- Keep item names short
- Show count per platform

## Age Calculation

- Order placed today → "Today"
- Order placed yesterday → "1 day old"
- Order placed 2+ days ago → "X days old" with ⚠️ if >3 days

## Error Handling
